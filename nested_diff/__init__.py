class Differ(object):
    """
    Compute recursive diff for two passed objects.

    Resulting diff is a dict and may contain following keys:
    `A` stands for 'added', it's value - added item.
    `D` means 'different' and contains subdiff.
    `I` index for list item, used only when prior item was omitted.
    `N` is a new value for changed item.
    `O` is a changed item's old value.
    `R` key used for removed item.
    `U` represent unchanged item.

    Diff metadata alternates with actual data; simple types specified as is,
    dicts, lists and tuples contain subdiffs for their items with native for
    such types addressing: indexes for lists and tuples and keys for
    dictionaries. Each status type, except `D` and `I`, may be (optionally)
    omitted during diff computation.

    Example:

    a:  {"one": [5,7]}
    b:  {"one": [5], "two": 2}
    opts: U=False  # omit unchanged items

    diff:
    {"D": {"one": {"D": [{"I": 1, "R": 7}]}, "two": {"A": 2}}}
    | |   |  |    | |   || |   |   |   |       |    | |   |
    | |   |  |    | |   || |   |   |   |       |    | |   +- with value 2
    | |   |  |    | |   || |   |   |   |       |    | +- key 'two' was added
    | |   |  |    | |   || |   |   |   |       |    +- subdiff for it
    | |   |  |    | |   || |   |   |   |       +- another key from top-level
    | |   |  |    | |   || |   |   |   +- what it was (item's value: 7)
    | |   |  |    | |   || |   |   +- what happened to item (removed)
    | |   |  |    | |   || |   +- list item's actual index
    | |   |  |    | |   || +- prior item was omitted
    | |   |  |    | |   |+- subdiff for list item
    | |   |  |    | |   +- it's value - list
    | |   |  |    | +- it is deeply changed
    | |   |  |    +- subdiff for key 'one'
    | |   |  +- it has key 'one'
    | |   +- top-level thing is a dict
    | +- changes somewhere deeply inside
