class Differ():
    """
    Compute recursive diff for two passed objects.

    Dicts, lists, tuples, sets and frozensets traversed recursively, other
    types compared by values. Any type diff may be customized by user-defined
    type handlers.

    Diff is a dict and may contain status keys:

    `A` stands for 'added', it's value - added item.
    `D` means 'different' and contains subdiff.
    `N` is a new value for changed item.
    `O` is a changed item's old value.
    `R` key used for removed item.
    `U` represent unchanged item.

    and auxiliary keys:

    `C` comment; optional, value - arbitrary string.
    `E` extension ID (optional).
    `I` index for sequence item, used only when prior item was omitted.

    Diff metadata alternates with actual data; simple types specified as is,
    dicts, lists and tuples contain subdiffs for their items with native for
    such types addressing: indexes for lists and tuples, keys for dictionaries.
    Any status key, except `D` may be omitted during diff computation. `E` key
    is used with `D` when entity unable to contain diff by itself (set,
    frozenset for example); `D` contain a list of subdiffs in this case.

    Example:
    a:  {"one": [5,7]}
    b:  {"one": [5], "two": 2}
    opts: U=False  # omit unchanged items

    diff:
    {"D": {"one": {"D": [{"I": 1, "R": 7}]}, "two": {"A": 2}}}

    | |   |  |    | |   || |   |   |   |       |    | |   +- with value 2
    | |   |  |    | |   || |   |   |   |       |    | +- key 'two' was added
    | |   |  |    | |   || |   |   |   |       |    +- subdiff for it
    | |   |  |    | |   || |   |   |   |       +- another key from top-level
    | |   |  |    | |   || |   |   |   +- what it was (item's value: 7)
    | |   |  |    | |   || |   |   +- what happened to item (removed)
    | |   |  |    | |   || |   +- list item's actual index
    | |   |  |    | |   || +- prior item was omitted
    | |   |  |    | |   |+- subdiff for list item
    | |   |  |    | |   +- it's value - list
    | |   |  |    | +- it is deeply changed
    | |   |  |    +- subdiff for key 'one'
    | |   |  +- it has key 'one'
